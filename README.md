# Overview
A two-stage approach was proposed for the detection of cervical spine fractures. The first step is to detect whether a fracture exists or not using a deep learning model. Classification helps identify cervical fractures. Our second step focuses on identifying the cervical spine vertebrae. The YOLOv8 model is used in this task in order to recognize and localize objects.
